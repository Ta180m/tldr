# tldr

My Linux cheatsheets, compatible with [tldr](https://tldr.sh/).


## Usage

Use this repo as the source: (not all clients may support this)

`tldr -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ta180m/tldr/main/pages`

You can add this as an alias to your shell.

If it doesn't work or shows official tldr pages, delete your tldr cache and try again.
