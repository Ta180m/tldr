# tldr

My Linux cheatsheets, compatible with [tldr](https://tldr.sh/). Most of the sheets are indended for my personal use, so no guarentee about the quality!


## Usage

Use this repo as the source: (not all clients may support this)

`tldr -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ta180m/tldr/main/pages`

You can add this as an alias to your shell. I typically alias it as `ta180m`.

If it doesn't work or shows official tldr pages, delete your tldr cache and try again.
